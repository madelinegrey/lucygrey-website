						<h3>documentary 220</h3>
						<p>Worked with one partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicki-abraham/">Nicki Abraham<a> on two short documentaries centering on a non profit organization in New London Connecticut called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/startfreshct/">Start Fresh</a> and one of the resettled families (The Mahlos). My partner and I were allowed the use of K100 Kodak 16mm Camera Kits. We were not afforded any lighting set ups or camera rigs besides a tripod. Together, Nicki and I created the whole project with help from Professor Morin and Greg Surmon of the film department. We also received a tremendous amount of help in terms of planning shoots and meeting families from Start Fresh and members of the Connecticut College community already working with the Mahlo family. This was our first filmmaking experience together and I was lucky to have such an ambitious and driven partner for my first film and first documentary.</p>

						<h2>"THE CHA(N)CE"</h2>
						<h3>fundamental motion picture production</h3>
						<p>An exercise our professor gave to let us practice matches on action and get comfortable using the camera equipment. My partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kayle-waterhouse-68163a103/">Kayle Waterhouse</a>, and I had the same equipment as we had for the documentary class. No lighting equipment and we were not allowed to color correct our films. Kayle and I came up with a quick chase scene story and gathered our friends to film. It was a fun exercise that allowed for us to create a quick story visually and find new angles to film standard actions. It forced us to think creatively and about our motivations when choosing how to shoot a scene. The exercise also prompted us to understand the value of getting numerous and a variety of shots for the editing room.</p>

						<h2>"COFFEE"</h2>
						<h3>fundamental motion picture production</h3>
						<p>My first short comedy and “motion picture production” where my partner (Kayle Waterhouse) and I struggled to find a story our professor would approved before we decided to make a film about a chronic yet simple objective that many on our small college campus face: getting a cup of coffee. We created obstacles, put a script together, and with a week of shooting we created our well received film, COFFEE.</p>

						<h2>"without consolidation, there is no recall"</h2>
						<h4>3 stages of the film (progress!)</h4>
						<h3>fundamental motion picture production</h3>
						<p>The second film of the semester was a montage. After going through examples of montages from past students, I went digging through old ideas and convinced my partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandra-bernardo-4b43a8149/">Alex Bernardo</a> to pursue the idea of a montage about insomnia. After making two very different versions of the film, my professor decided he thought a different actor would benefit us better, so I went to my friend who has insomnia, shot more footage for about an hour and then went back to the editing lab. The sound of this film was pieces of audio recorded and made from <a href="https://madelinegrey.github.io/">Madeline Grey</a>’s body and recorded by her for a separate class she was taking at the time. Alex let me focus on the sound design mainly because she was unfamiliar with the sounds. After a long editing process, we got our final montage!</p>

						<h2>"WINDWARD"</h2>
						<h3>fundamental motion picture production</h3>
						<p>The third film of the semester was the longest and most demanding of the semester. New requirements for this film included a longer script length and full pre-production scheduling sheets, shot lists, scripts etc that my professor had to approve before we could go ahead and shoot the film. My professor also wanted higher production value on our films meaning he wanted us to shoot outside of our college campus. Thus my film partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/quentin-parker-4a508aab/">Quentin Parker</a>, and I hiked a mile or so up to find our cliffs for the final scene. This film was a lot of fun to work on and it was truly a rewarding experience to make this film with Quentin and understand how our script and film changed as we shot and what remained the same from the beginning. The actors were also troopers in the bitter cold and harsh wind. For this film, like all the others, we had the same camera kit and only myself and a partner to create these movies.</p>

						<h2>"BOOTSTRAPS"</h2>
						<h3>experimental film history and practice</h3>
						<p>Shot on K100 Kodak 16mm Camera Kit (includes sekonic light meter and tripod). I alone came up with the idea, shot list, and controlled the camera on this shoot, but I worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggie-newell-0b2316154/">Maggie Newell</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-losiewicz-313891153/">Charlie Losiewicz</a> during the shoot for set up, lighting, tips and helpful ideas along the way. They were essential to making this film come to life. In the editing room, it was back to a solo project and downloading strange sounds off of youtube due to time. I would like to remake this film with sound that I record one day. The film is a commentary on the “American Dream” and the phrase “pull yourself up by the bootstraps.”</p>

						<h2>"AUTHORS"</h2>
						<h3>experimental film history and production</h3>
						<p>While taking this course, I was taking a film theory course taught by Dr. Martin called Women Directors. This course heavily influenced the film along with a book given to me by my creative writing professor at the time Professor Soffer. I asked some important women in my life to help me shoot this film. I gave them the camera and I told them to record us being joyful, record us being together, because we are all the authors. I still feel like this film is unfinished, especially in its sound design but it still means the world to me. I hope to build on this film more and hopefully take it further away from a comment I received in class that still haunts me when I watch it. The comment was saying that the film looks like a sorority girl party...i.e. shallow, hegemonic, toxic. I hope my future work reflects nothing of the sort.</p>

      <div class="home content visible" id="about">
        <p>I am a filmmaker, writer, and coach in training. I studied Film Studies and English with a concentration in Fiction Writing at Connecticut College. I got into filmmaking while at college, but I have always been a sucker for a good film and dreamed of writing my own. I’ve always written things down but mainly kept most work to myself. However, the courses I took at school have pushed me to be courageous with my writing and has benefited both my filmmaking interests and writing interests.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Soccer has always been apart of my life, but I am too injured to pursue a career as a player and therefore am now a coach in training. So far, I have my 4v4 Coaching License from US Soccer and aim to pursue at least a D license certification.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Since graduating college, I have been eagerly searching for a way to grow and use my skills in a creative and collaborative atmosphere. I am keen on learning both more technical writing/film skills and inspiring more creative endeavors as well.</p>
